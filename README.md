# YouTube Telegram Bot
### Description and Running of the bot
This is the zero version of a bot for downloading videos from YouTube for my purposes, written “quick-and-dirty”. As time passes, I will improve and upgrade the bot.
\
The bot can be used for your needs according to the brief instructions below:
\

Сlone the repository
\
```git clone https://github.com/DanisBikmaev/yt-tg-bot.git```
\
\
Install the necessary dependencies
\
```pip install -r  requirements.txt```
\
\
Create an environment file .env
\
```touch .env```
\
\
And insert your bot token instead of YOUR_TOKEN in the .env file
\
```TG_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN```
\
\
Run the bot
\
```python main.py```
\
\

In your bot, send a link to a YouTube video
